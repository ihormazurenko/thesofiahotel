                                <p>The Pilates method refers to a series of conditioning exercises that combine stretching, elongating, strengthening and breathing. This form of exercise has become popular for its low stress approach to building strength, increasing flexibility and its emphasis on balance and posture. These carefully executed movements can help you to become more aware of strengths and weaknesses in your body, achieve greater balance, coordination and symmetry and help you to avoid injury in day-to-day activities.
